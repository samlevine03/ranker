# Ranker

This project is a React-based ranking engine where users can rank items (e.g., movies) into three categories: Good, Fine, and Bad. The ranking is based on user comparisons, using a binary search-like approach to determine where new items should be placed among previously ranked items. Foodies may recognize this as the same ranking approach used by the app 'Beli'.
